# Tamagotchi 2022-2023
Computer Architecture project inspired to Tamagotchi game, for **LPC1768** Development Board (LandTiger)

## Requirements
- MDK-Arm (Keil Î¼Vision 5)
- Arm Compiler 5.06 update 7 (build 960) Win32

Note: a professional license of Keil is needed, otherwise it will not compile due to the length of the code.

### Exam template
It is not needed for running the game, but could be very useful for starting a project from scatch (or for the ASE exam ðŸ˜‰).
